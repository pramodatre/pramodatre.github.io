Acquiring skills takes focused effort and deliberate practice. I strongly believe that anyone can be skillful with exposure to right training and feedback. When I tried to acquire new skills, I found that most of the courses I took was knowledge-centric (in academia and online). This was painfully slow to acquire skills I wanted. I wondered why can't the courses focus on skills? Why can't we build something and in the process acquire new skills (including deep theory skills such as algorithm design, probability theory, linear algebra, and optimization)? To share my learning and help you acquire skills, I'm generating content that emphasizes skill-building and craftsmanship using a hands-on approach. Here are some digital products that focus on skill building.
