I'm a Researcher and Engineer working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision related topics. I enjoy working on fun projects in my spare time. I like to bike and hike if I'm not doing any projects.

I have experience developing research projects ground-up in both academia and industry. Here is my older webpage summarizing my [PhD life](https://pramodatre.github.io/old_site/).

Recently, I have started to explore ideas of interactive teaching experiences to teach skills using deliberate practice principles. I strongly believe that meeting a good teacher will be a life changing experience for students. Keeping students motivated to learn is crucial and technology has a great potential to deliver great teaching and learning experiences.
