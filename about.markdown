I apply Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve data problems. I'm fascinated by the unreasonable effectiveness of learning algorithms to solve real-world challenges of business and practical value. I have experience working in fast-paced, interdisciplinary, and multi-cultural teams in academia and industry.

During my Ph.D., I developed techniques to augment machine learning algorithms with declarative domain knowledge to solve challenging problems in understanding non-linear time-series dynamics, event extraction from text, and assess impact of events on city infrastructure (e.g., road network). I have lead successful research projects in healthcare and sustainability resulting in products, publications, and patents.

I have published my work at Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems venues such as AAAI, ACM TIST, SDM and ACM Web Science. I have been on technical program committee for conferences and journals such as WWW, ISWC, ESWC, IJCAI, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal, and IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

Skills: Machine learning, Computer Vision, Predictive Analytics, Time-series Data Analysis, Anomaly Detection, Information Extraction, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.
